# Enigma-Simulator
Simulates an Enigma machine

A (potentially outdated) build can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ltD9UtSPMLAYL3TrhXXglumO-CNnsrt1?usp=sharing

Uses rotor wirings found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details

Produces identical results to these two simulators:  
https://piotte13.github.io/enigma-cipher/  
https://www.101computing.net/enigma-machine-emulator/

- A dash above the leftmost rotor indicated that it is not in use
- The final encrypted message would not have spaces or new lines however these are included for ease of use
- The plugboard would never have more than 10 connections however this is supported
- Backspaces weren't supported on the original enigma but work here for convenience
